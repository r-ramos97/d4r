# Building d4r

These steps produce the pieces the launcher needs: a patched ZLUDA, a patched vkd3d-proton, the NGX shim and CUDA bridge, a staged runtime directory with your NVIDIA files, and the native kernels. The versions below are the ones that were tested; others may need changes.

| Component | Tested version |
|---|---|
| ZLUDA | `ee2f25a` (upstream), plus `patches/zluda/0002` through `0007` in order |
| vkd3d-proton | `3dfc6f07` (the base GE-Proton11-3 ships), plus `patches/vkd3d-proton/0001` |
| ROCm | 7.2 (HIP runtime, clang, device libraries) |
| Proton | GE-Proton11-3 (with its OptiScaler integration) |
| DLSS | `nvngx_dlss.dll` 310.7.0 |

## 1. ZLUDA

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA zluda && cd zluda
git checkout ee2f25a
git submodule update --init --recursive
git lfs pull
for p in 0002 0003 0004 0005 0006 0007; do git apply /path/to/d4r/patches/zluda/$p-*.patch; done
# rebuild the device helpers the patches changed (ptx/lib/zluda_ptx_impl*.bc)
ZLUDA_SOURCE_ROOT=$PWD ROCM_ROOT=/opt/rocm /path/to/d4r/scripts/build_zluda_ptx_helpers.sh
LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/rocm/lib cargo build --release -p zluda
LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/rocm/lib cargo build --release -p ptx --example d4r_emit
mkdir -p ~/.cache/d4r-zluda-current
cp target/release/libnvcuda.so ~/.cache/d4r-zluda-current/
ln -sf libnvcuda.so ~/.cache/d4r-zluda-current/libcuda.so
```

Build the release ZLUDA library on a system or in a container with GLIBC 2.41 or older. A binary
linked on a newer system can require newer GLIBC symbols even when the ZLUDA source does not need new
GLIBC features. Before packaging, check it with
`scripts/check_glibc_compat.sh 2.41 /path/to/libnvcuda.so`. The release packager runs the same
check on ZLUDA, the Wine CUDA bridge, and every bundled ROCm library. Test the rebuilt library
with the D3D12 harness and in a game before publishing a release.

The launcher looks for ZLUDA in `D4R_ZLUDA_DIR` (default `~/.cache/d4r-zluda-current`, or `ZludaDir` in d4r.ini).

What the patches add:

- **0002**: the CUDA driver API surface NGX and DLSS use (arrays, textures, surfaces, 1010102 formats, launch parameter buffers), the PTX features DLSS kernels need, and module dumps for debugging (`D4R_ZLUDA_DUMP_DIR`).
- **0003**: an implicit 256-thread launch bound for kernels without PTX bounds (removes massive register spilling, `D4R_ZLUDA_IMPLICIT_MAX_BLOCK`) and f16 tensor-core MMA on RDNA3 WMMA (`D4R_ZLUDA_WMMA`).
- **0004**: the native kernel override hook (`D4R_ZLUDA_NATIVE_DIR`, see [native-kernels.md](native-kernels.md)), FP8 MMA on WMMA (`D4R_ZLUDA_WMMA_FP8`), optional elision of per-instruction denormal mode switches (`D4R_ZLUDA_IGNORE_DENORMAL`), inlined image helpers, and linking extra bitcode into a PTX module (`D4R_ZLUDA_EXTRA_BC`, used by the texture-kernel build).
- **0005**: a null texture object (CUDA handle 0) reads as zeros, as on NVIDIA GPUs, instead of faulting the GPU. DLSS samples absent optional inputs that way in some configurations (low-resolution motion vectors without HDR, as in Ghost of Tsushima).
- **0006**: `m16n8k8` f16 MMAs (DLSS 3 CNN, presets E/F) on RDNA3 WMMA like the k16 ones (`D4R_ZLUDA_WMMA_K8=0` disables it); weight-image slots for native prep kernels (`d4r_prep_key_at`, `d4r_prep_key_slots`); and wave64 compilation for offline texture-kernel builds (`D4R_ZLUDA_WAVE64=1`, with wave64 builds of the helper bitcode). `scripts/build_zluda_ptx_helpers.sh` now writes the `_w64` helper variants too.
- **0007**: gfx12 WMMA layout lowering, optional native e4m3 FP8 WMMA (`D4R_ZLUDA_WMMA_FP8_NATIVE=1`), and an architecture argument for `d4r_emit`. `D4R_ZLUDA_WMMA_LAYOUT=12` on gfx11 is a validation shim, not a release setting.

When linking on a system with ROCm libraries outside the default search path, include their library directory in `LIBRARY_PATH`. The build also needs the appropriate ROCm link libraries. `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=8` caps parallel Rust compilation if memory is limited.

## 2. vkd3d-proton

```sh
scripts/build_vkd3d_proton_d4r.sh ~/.cache/d4r-vkd3d-d4r
```

The patch lets the shim split the game's command list at the DLSS call, so the rest of the frame waits (at queue level) for DLSS instead of showing the previous frame's result. Point `D4R_VKD3D_DIR` (or `VkD3DDir` in d4r.ini) at the output. Without it the shim falls back to showing a one-frame-old result.

## 3. Shim, bridge and NVAPI identity

```sh
scripts/build_d4r_nvngx_shim.sh      # build/d4r_nvngx.dll   (needs x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ and clang-cl)
scripts/build_wine_nvcuda_bridge.sh  # build/wine-nvcuda/    (needs winegcc and winebuild)
```

The launcher builds the small NVAPI identity bridge (`scripts/build_d4r_nvapi_identity.sh`) itself.

## 4. Runtime directory

```sh
scripts/install_d4r_runtime.sh /path/to/_nvngx.dll /path/to/nvngx_dlss.dll
```

This stages the shim, the bridge, the NGX core and the DLSS feature library in `D4R_RUNTIME_DIR` (default `~/.local/share/d4r-dlss`, or `RuntimeDir` in d4r.ini). The NVIDIA files come from your own sources, for example an NVIDIA driver package (NGX core) and a game or the DLSS SDK (feature library).

## 5. Native kernels

```sh
D4R_ROCM_DIR=/opt/rocm \
D4R_DLSS_DLL=/path/to/nvngx_dlss.dll \
D4R_ZLUDA_EMIT=/path/to/zluda/target/release/examples/d4r_emit \
kernels/build.sh all kernels/out/native
```

`kernels/out/native` then holds one code object per replaced DLSS kernel; set `NativeKernelDirFast` in d4r.ini (or `D4R_ZLUDA_NATIVE_DIR`) to it. `kernels/build.sh k` or `m` builds only the network layers and needs neither the DLL nor ZLUDA. The texture kernels (`tex`) extract PTX from your DLL into `kernels/extracted/` and compile it offline for `D4R_GPU_ARCH` through `D4R_ZLUDA_EMIT`; that directory and the build output are git-ignored and must not be redistributed. On gfx12, build a second variant with `D4R_NATIVE_FP8=1` and place it in an `<arch>-fp8` folder.

To add the accuracy option to a developer set, repeat the build with `D4R_PREFER_ACCURACY=1` and output `kernels/out/native/accuracy` (multi-target builds: `kernels/accuracy/<arch>` and `<arch>-fp8`). Use a separate empty directory; successfully built accuracy sets receive `d4r-accuracy.txt`. Enable `[Kernels] PreferAccuracy = true` and restart. The option defaults to false and never substitutes the fast set when accuracy binaries are absent.

## 6. Configure and play

The first launch copies `config/d4r.ini.default` to `~/.config/d4r/d4r.ini`. Set the `[Launch]` paths (Proton, the game's compatdata prefix and the game executable), the `[Paths]` above, and the model in `[DLSS]`, then run:

```sh
scripts/d4r_play.sh
```

In the game, pick DLSS as the upscaler (OptiScaler intercepts it). Every setting in the file can also be given as an environment variable, which takes precedence; `D4R_NO_CONFIG=1` ignores the file.

## 7. Package a release

```sh
scripts/fetch_rocm_runtime.sh         # -> ~/.cache/d4r-rocm-runtime (AMD's ROCm 7.2.4 runtime, checksummed)
D4R_OPTISCALER=/path/to/OptiScaler_0.9.4.7z \
D4R_DLSS_DLLS=/path/to/310.7/nvngx_dlss.dll:/path/to/310.9/nvngx_dlss.dll \
D4R_BUNDLE_DLSS=/path/to/nvngx_dlss.dll D4R_BUNDLE_NGX=/path/to/_nvngx.dll D4R_BUNDLE_TEX=kernels/out/native \
D4R_ZLUDA_DIR=~/.cache/d4r-zluda-current D4R_VKD3D_DIR=~/.cache/d4r-vkd3d-d4r D4R_ROCM_DIR=/opt/rocm \
D4R_ZLUDA_EMIT=/path/to/zluda/target/release/examples/d4r_emit \
scripts/package_release.sh            # -> dist/d4r-<version>.zip
```

The script:
- builds the shim, the bridge and both fast and accuracy network-layer kernels for gfx1100–gfx1103 and gfx1200–gfx1201 by default (`D4R_GPU_ARCHS` can select fewer targets); each gfx12 target also gets an `<arch>-fp8` variant;
- writes the kernel manifest from the DLLs you list (it records hashes of their PTX, nothing else);
- stages OptiScaler as `dxgi.dll` with the settings in `packaging/optiscaler.settings`;
- adds NVIDIA's two DLLs and any supplied texture kernels (built from NVIDIA's PTX by `kernels/build.sh tex`); builds accuracy texture sets with `D4R_ZLUDA_EMIT` unless marked prebuilt sets are supplied in `D4R_BUNDLE_TEX/accuracy/<target>`;
- zips the result together with the ZLUDA and vkd3d-proton builds, the ROCm runtime (as `d4r/rocm`), `packaging/d4r.ini`, the licenses and the patches.

The NVIDIA files are not covered by d4r's license; redistributing them is up to whoever publishes the zip. `D4R_BUNDLE_NVIDIA=0` builds `d4r-<version>-nonvidia.zip` without them and without the texture kernels. [architecture.md](architecture.md#portable-installs-the-release-zip) describes how the installed files work together.

### GLIBC 2.41 release builds

Build the pinned environment with:

```sh
docker build -f packaging/build/Dockerfile.glibc241 -t d4r-build:glibc241 packaging/build
```

Inside that image, `scripts/build_release_glibc241.sh` rebuilds the GPU device helpers, ZLUDA and its LLVM, `d4r_emit`, the NGX shim, Wine CUDA bridge, patched vkd3d-proton, and performance/accuracy texture sets for every release target. Packaging then builds both network sets, checks all bundled Linux libraries against 2.41, and records the toolchain in `d4r/source/BUILD_INFO.txt`.

Mount the repository at `/work`, ROCm's compiler/headers/device libraries at `/opt/rocm`, and an official Rust toolchain (1.98.0 used for 0.1.3) at `/opt/rust`, with `/opt/rust/bin` on `PATH`. Keep toolchain and third-party runtime inputs read-only. Supply the normal package inputs listed above and these build settings:

| Variable | Input |
|---|---|
| `D4R_RELEASE_BUILD_ROOT` | writable directory under `/work/build/` |
| `D4R_ZLUDA_SRC` | isolated checkout inside that directory, with both pinned LLVM and HiGHS submodules, the real OCKL LFS payload, and patches `0002`–`0007` applied |
| `D4R_VKD3D_SRC` | isolated vkd3d-proton checkout inside that directory, with its submodules and patch `0001` applied |
| `CARGO_HOME` | writable build-local Cargo cache; prefetch the locked dependencies for an offline build |
| `D4R_ROCM_DIR` | `/opt/rocm` |
| `D4R_ROCM_LINK_STUBS` | optional directory for additional ROCm link libraries |

Run `bash scripts/build_release_glibc241.sh` inside the container. The script checks that the build system actually reports `glibc 2.41`, rejects external source-cache checkouts, builds with the locked Cargo dependencies offline, and runs the configuration tests before packaging. The ZIP and checksum go in `$D4R_RELEASE_BUILD_ROOT/dist/`; logs and `toolchain.txt` remain in the build directory. AMD's bundled ROCm runtime, OptiScaler and NVIDIA's libraries remain supplied binaries; the Linux ABI check covers the bundled ROCm libraries too.

`D4R_BUNDLE_TEX` accepts the older flat directory for gfx1101, or a directory with per-target subdirectories (`gfx1100/`–`gfx1103/`, `gfx1200/`, `gfx1201/`, plus `gfx1200-fp8/` and `gfx1201-fp8/`). Build each texture set with `D4R_GPU_ARCH` and `D4R_ZLUDA_EMIT`; the `-fp8` sets also need `D4R_NATIVE_FP8=1`. `d4r_emit` targets those GPUs offline. Missing texture kernels fall back to ZLUDA on that target; the network-layer kernels are still included. Only the RX 7700 XT has been tested on real hardware.

## Checks

- `scripts/check_environment.sh` lists the tools, GPUs (with the one d4r uses) and Proton builds it finds.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v` runs the CPU tests: configuration, native kernel selection and
  `packaging/d4r-check.sh`. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs them with ShellCheck and builds the shim and
  the bridge on every push; the native kernels need ROCm and are not built there.
- The D3D12 harness (`scripts/run_d3d12_dlss_harness_proton.sh`) drives DLSS outside a game.
- Native kernels have their own validation path; see [native-kernels.md](native-kernels.md).
